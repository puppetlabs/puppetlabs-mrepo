CHANGELOG

1.1.0
=====

  * Correct invalid Modulefile dependency
  * Changes to conform to style guide.
  * Allow tuning of email recipient
  * Add in mrepo::exports class
  * Add in support for creating NFS shares of mrepo disks. This is primarily
    needed for mirroring and building on SLES.

1.0.0
=====

This is a backwards incompatible release.

  * Split out mirroring for RHN and NCC repositories, since they have
    nontrivial amounts of logic needed to authenticate to the mirror source.
  * Add hour parameter to mrepo::repo define to permit staggering
    synchronization time.
  * Add mrepo::iso define. This will copy ISOs from to the mrepo host for
    mirroring from ISOs. This adds a dependency on nanliu-staging
  * Clean up repository name munging by extracting the logic into a Puppet
    function.
  * Respect mrepo docroot for apache
