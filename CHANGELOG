CHANGELOG

1.0.0
=====

This is a backwards incompatible release.

  * Split out mirroring for RHN and NCC repositories, since they have
    nontrivial amounts of logic needed to authenticate to the mirror source.
  * Add hour parameter to mrepo::repo define to permit staggering
    synchronization time.
  * Add mrepo::iso define. This will copy ISOs from to the mrepo host for
    mirroring from ISOs. This adds a dependency on nanliu-staging
  * Clean up repository name munging by extracting the logic into a Puppet
    function.
  * Respect mrepo docroot for apache
